# Talking Kotlin Android App

[![Hex.pm](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/badge_new.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talkingkotlin)

Hi there! This is an android app for TalkingKotlin.com, a podcast about all the Kotlin things.

## Goodies

- Kotlin
- MVPVM
- Android Architecture Components (LiveData, ViewModel, etc.)
- Deep linking to directly access episodes from urls

## Feature Wish List 

- Add extra data posted on the website of talkingkotlin but can't be added through SoundCloud
- Make the app more social (shares, likes, etc.) 
- A detail screen for each episode

### Mea culpa

- Not enough tests (WIP)
- No DI (Dagger2? Kodein? Koin?)
- No Gradle Kotlin DSL (yet)

## Contribute!

This project was started by [Alexander Gherschon](https://twitter.com/galex), and of course, you are more than welcome to contribute to this project.

The only thing I would kindly like to ask is to not publish this app yourself on the Play Store, but to contribute to this project and work together to improve it!
